## 1. **Program Description**

In this Challenge, you’ll apply your understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, you will examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

This notebook will be divided into seven steps that will find the best value for k using the original scaled DataFrame, cluster cryptocurrencies with K-Means using the original scaled DataFrame, optimize the clusters with PCA, find the best value for k using the PCA data, cluster cryptocurrencies with K-Means using the PCA data, and then determine the weights of each feature on each PCA.
